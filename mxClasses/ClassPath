Unfortunately, this project relies on some of Macromedias' mx classes.

Which means you need a copy of the classes that come with a flash 8 install

then apply the remoting components installer found here 
http://www.adobe.com/products/flashremoting/downloads/components/

Once that is done, you either have to compile flashbsm from the flash ide 
or apply some more patches before mtasc will compile the mx classes

Then you must apply the core8 and mx patches found here 
http://www.osflash.org/mx_v2_components_patch

(which only seems to work in windows with the windows version of patch
http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/patch.htm

And then you must apply the diff I made as found in this folder with this command
