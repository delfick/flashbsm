Unfortunately, this project relies on some of Macromedias' mx classes.

Which means you need a copy of the classes that come with a flash 8 install

then apply the remoting components installer found here
http://www.adobe.com/products/flashremoting/downloads/components/

Once that is done, you either have to compile flashbsm from the flash ide
or apply some more patches before mtasc will compile the mx classes

Then you must apply the core8 and mx patches found here
http://www.osflash.org/mx_v2_components_patch

(which only seems to work in windows with the windows version of patch
http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/patch.htm

Once that is done, there is still some changes that must be made.
It took me a few hours to do, but lucky for you I've made a patch file for you to use

find the diff in this folder and you can use this command to apply it :
$ patch -p0 < fromOriginal.patch
